Building an Automatic Solar Tracker with Arduino UNO

Introduction

Solar energy is one of the most abundant and sustainable sources of power. However, the efficiency of solar panels depends on their orientation relative to the Sun. A solar tracker is a system designed to automatically adjust the position of solar panels to ensure they receive maximum sunlight throughout the day.

This project focuses on building an Automatic Solar Tracker using Arduino UNO, which uses Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) and a servo motor to detect and follow the Sun‚Äôs movement. The Arduino UNO processes real-time light intensity data from the LDRs and controls the servo motor to adjust the panel‚Äôs position accordingly.

By implementing an automatic solar tracker, we can significantly increase the efficiency of solar panels, making them more effective in generating electricity. This project provides a practical approach to understanding embedded systems, automation, and renewable energy applications.


Theory 

A solar tracker is a system that automatically adjusts the orientation of solar panels to ensure they receive the maximum amount of sunlight throughout the day. Traditional fixed solar panels are limited in efficiency because the Sun moves across the sky, changing its position from morning to evening. A solar tracking system overcomes this limitation by continuously adjusting the panel's angle to maximize energy absorption.

Working Principle

The Automatic Solar Tracker operates based on the principle of light intensity detection using Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) and a servo motor controlled by an Arduino UNO.

1. Light Sensing:
The system uses two or more LDRs placed at different positions on the solar panel.
LDRs change their resistance based on the intensity of incident light.
If one side of the panel receives more light than the other, the resistance difference is detected by the Arduino.
2. Microcontroller Processing (Arduino UNO):
The Arduino reads the analog signals from the LDRs and compares their values.
If a significant difference is detected, the Arduino sends control signals to the servo motor.
3. Panel Adjustment (Servo Motor):
The servo motor moves the panel toward the direction where light intensity is higher.
This process continues throughout the day, ensuring optimal alignment with the Sun.
Components

1. Arduino UNO

The Arduino UNO is the main microcontroller that processes data from the LDR module and controls the servo motor.
It reads analog signals from the LDRs and determines the required movement for the solar panel.
Based on the light intensity, it sends control signals to the servo motor to adjust the panel's position.
Easy to program using the Arduino IDE.
Has multiple analog inputs to read LDR signals.
Provides PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) output, which is required for controlling the servo motor.

2. Servo Motor

A servo motor is used to rotate the solar panel in the direction of maximum sunlight.
It receives control signals from the Arduino UNO and adjusts the panel‚Äôs angle accordingly.
Provides precise angle control.
Operates at low power, making it suitable for solar applications.
Can rotate between 0¬∞ and 180¬∞, depending on the tracking requirement.

3. Resistors

Resistors are used to limit current flow and ensure the proper functioning of components.
In the LDR module, resistors form a voltage divider circuit to convert light intensity into a measurable voltage for the Arduino.
Prevents excessive current flow that could damage the LDRs or Arduino
Helps in accurate voltage measurements from the LDR module.



4. Solar Panel

The main energy source in the system, converting sunlight into electricity.
The solar tracker helps maximize power generation by keeping the panel aligned with the Sun.
Provides renewable and sustainable energy.
Increases energy efficiency when paired with a tracking system.
Can be used to power Arduino and other circuit components with a battery storage system.

5. LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) Module

The LDR module detects the intensity of sunlight.
It consists of two or more LDRs, which change their resistance based on the amount of light falling on them.
The Arduino compares the readings from different LDRs to determine the direction in which the panel should move.
Simple and cost-effective light sensor.
Provides real-time light intensity data.
Works with a wide range of light levels, making it ideal for solar tracking.


Working 

1. The LDR module detects the light intensity from different directions.
2. The Arduino UNO processes this data and determines which direction has the most sunlight.
3. The servo motor moves the solar panel toward the brighter side.
4. The solar panel generates electricity efficiently due to proper alignment with the Sun.
5. Resistors ensure stable electrical signals for accurate tracking.
This combination of components creates a simple yet efficient automatic solar tracking system, improving the performance of solar panels.

The Automatic Solar Tracker continuously adjusts the position of a solar panel to maximize sunlight absorption using Arduino UNO, an LDR module, a servo motor, resistors, and a solar panel. Below is the step-by-step working principle based on these components:

Step 1: Light Detection using LDR Module

The LDR module consists of two or more LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors) placed at different positions on the solar panel.
LDRs change their resistance based on the intensity of sunlight.
When sunlight falls on both LDRs equally, their resistance remains the same.
If one LDR receives more light than the other, a difference in resistance occurs.




Step 2: Signal Processing by Arduino UNO

The Arduino reads the analog voltage values from the LDR module.
It compares the light intensity from both LDRs:
If both LDRs receive equal light, the panel remains stationary.
If one side is brighter, Arduino calculates the difference and sends a signal to the servo motor to adjust the panel.

Step 3: Movement of Solar Panel using Servo Motor
The servo motor receives commands from Arduino and moves the solar panel towards the direction where the light intensity is higher.
The movement continues until the light is balanced between both LDRs.
The panel follows the Sun throughout the day, continuously adjusting its position.

Step 4: Solar Energy Conversion

The solar panel receives the maximum possible sunlight exposure due to tracking.

It converts solar energy into electrical energy, which can be stored in batteries or used directly to power devices.

Step 5: System Reset for the Next Day

After sunset, the system can be programmed to reset and return to its initial position, ready for the next day‚Äôs tracking.
This can be achieved using a real-time clock (RTC) module or by detecting light levels in the early morning.

Code explanation 

#include <Servo.h>  // Includes the Servo motor library

Brings in a library that lets you easily control a servo motor.

#define LDR1 A0
#define LDR2 A1
#define error 10

LDR1 and LDR2 are connected to analog pins A0 and A1.
error defines the tolerance level. If the light difference is less than or equal to 10, the motor won‚Äôt move. This avoids jitter.

int Spoint =  90;
Servo servo;

Spoint sets the initial angle of the servo (90 degrees ‚Äì center).
servo is the object used to control the servo motor.

üîÅ setup() function
servo.attach(11); 

Connects the servo to pin 11.

servo.write(Spoint);
delay(1000);

Moves the servo to the starting point (90 degrees) and waits for 1 second.

üîÅ loop() function
This is where the tracking magic happens! It keeps checking light levels and adjusts the motor.
int ldr1 = analogRead(LDR1);
int ldr2 = analogRead(LDR2);

Reads the light levels from both LDRs.
Higher value = more light.
int value1 = abs(ldr1 - ldr2);
int value2 = abs(ldr2 - ldr1);

Calculates the difference in light levels between the two LDRs.
(Note: These two are technically the same. Using just one is enough.)
if ((value1 <= error) || (value2 <= error)) {
  // Do nothing if the difference is small
} else {
  if (ldr1 > ldr2) {
    Spoint = --Spoint; // Rotate to the left
  }
  if (ldr1 < ldr2) {
    Spoint = ++Spoint; // Rotate to the right
  }
}


If both LDRs detect similar light (difference is within 10), do nothing.
If one LDR detects more light, it adjusts the servo to rotate towards that side.
servo.write(Spoint);
delay(80);

Writes the updated angle to the servo.
Waits 80ms before the next adjustment.
